In response, Notre Dame Lead Innovation Team (ND LIT) was formed. Through community partnerships, ND LITâ€™s goal is to give community members the knowledge and ability to fight this issue and protect families from lead. See more information. Heidi Beidinger, assistant professor of the practice in the Department of Biology and ND LIT team member, will chair our discussion of how they are addressing this threat and what scientists can do to help.",
