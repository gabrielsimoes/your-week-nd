His early work was on asceticism and anthropology, focusing on St.\u00a0Irenaeus of Lyons and Clement of Alexandria (OUP 2000). He is writing a series of books on \u201cThe Formation of Christian Theology\u201d, two volumes of which have already appeared: vol. 1,\u00a0The Way to Nicaea\u00a0(SVS Press 2001) and vol. 2\u00a0The Nicene Faith\u00a0(SVS Press 2003). On the basis of these two volumes, he published a synthetic work,\u00a0The Mystery of Christ: Life in Death\u00a0(SVS 2006).

Wolf\u2019s performance sparked a lively debate on social media and news outlets dissecting whether it is appropriate and productive to ridicule, in such an explicit way, men and women who might have contributed to the rise of American Fascism. By means of the romantic comedies that Vittorio De Sica shot under Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship, this seminar\u2014sponsored by the Center for Italian Studies\u2014will pause on different modes of laughing at fascists and Fascism. De Sica\u2019s Maddalena Zero in Conduct (1940) and Teresa Venerd\u00ec (1941), and A Garibaldian in the Convent (1942) have been traditionally discarded as juvenile concessions to a politics of escapism. Instead, we will explore the ways in which these rom-coms challenge fascist command and highlight that happiness can be achieved only by eschewing state-sanctioned codes of conduct.\nLorenzo Fabbri is assistant professor in Italian and Moving Image Studies at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

Backed by the United States, the land-swap suggestion has brought with it questions about its possible consequences for the Balkan region. With the 1990s wars far from forgotten, many have warned against setting a dangerous precedent for redrawing national borders along ethnic lines. This holds particularly true for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has largely been territorially divided and where conflict has been institutionalized. Equally importantly, this development raises issues for peace scholars and practitioners. Can peace in a multiethnic society ever be achieved, especially after periods of oppression, human rights violation, and in some cases, acts of genocide? What are the conditions that might allow that peace to take root and what forms could it take? The panel aims to address these questions by bringing the situation in the Balkans into conversation with other regions, most notably the Kurdish region in Iraq.\nOriginally published at kroc.nd.edu.", "location": "C103, Hesburgh Center for International Studies", "whole_days": [], "partial_days": [{"day": "2019-04-23", "start": "04:00 PM", "end": "05:30 PM"}], "categories": ["lectures_and_conferences", "open_to_the_public", "college_of_arts_and_letters", "cal_keough"]}, "Ravarino Lecture: \"Ulysses or Penelope? Women writers rethink the Mediterranean\"": {"title": "Ravarino Lecture: \"Ulysses or Penelope? Women writers rethink the Mediterranean\"", "description": "The Center for Italian Studies presents the third annual Ravarino Lecture delivered by Lucia Re, professor of Italian at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOnce known simply as the mare nostrum\u2014our sea\u2014\u201cthe Mediterranean\u201d is a theme that has received in the last few decades seemingly endless attention, generating a rich, complex and varied bibliography in many languages. The Mediterranean Sea is, etymologically, \u201cthe sea between lands,\u201d a body of relatively navigable waters surrounded by the shores of three continents\u2014Europe, Asia and Africa. \u201cThe Mediterranean,\u201d however, has increasingly in the modern and contemporary era been perceived as a highly fluid, fluctuating, multiple, poly-linguistic and hybrid area of multiple interactions, exchanges and violent conflicts, or, as suggested by Iain Chambers \u201can intricate site of encounters and currents.\u201d\n\nIn Franco Cassano\u2019s Pensiero Meridiano (Southern Mediterranean Thought), Ulysses\u2014the eternal wanderer who must continue to leave even as he dreams of going home to Ithaca\u2014is still today the enduring archetype of what Cassano calls \u201cMediterranean Man\u201d: \u201cWhat makes Ulysses great [\u2026] is the ability to house within himself this wandering and at the same time the desire to return.\u201d But what about \u201cMediterranean Woman\u201d?\n\nThis presentation argues that some contemporary women writers, poets, critics and philosophers, including Adriana Cavarero, Toni Maraini, Caterina Resta, Francesca Saffioti and Bianca Tarozzi, use the Italian idiom to write about the Mediterranean in a different way. This new approach to the Mediterranean may be defined as a creative and critical expansion and revision of the myth and semantic possibilities of the figure of Penelope, seen in contrast and opposition to the figure of Ulysses\u2014archetypal Mediterranean hero, defiant explorer, and consummate yet deceitful storyteller. These women in fact use writing itself to resist and oppose the deceptions of patriarchal norms and limits, and to imagine new and different cartographies of the postcolonial Mediterranean.\nLucia Re (Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, Yale University) is Professor of Italian with an appointment also in the UCLA Department of Gender Studies. Her principal fields of study and teaching are modern and contemporary literature and culture. Her interests include poetry and the novel, women writers and artists, feminist theory, futurism and the avant-garde, Italy and the Mediterranean, race studies, and literary translation.

For the edition of Amelia Rosselli\u2019s volume of poetry, War Variations (translated with Paul Vangelisti), she was awarded the 2006 PEN USA literary translation award, as well as the Flaiano Prize for International Italian Studies. Prof. Re has published more than eighty scholarly articles and essays on authors ranging from Gabriele d\u2019Annunzio to Anna Maria Ortese.
