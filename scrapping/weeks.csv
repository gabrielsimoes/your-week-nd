As a teacher, you’re viewed by students as a source of instruction, assistance and sometimes personal support.

Other students won’t intentionally share their problems with you, but you may notice indirectly expressed signs of personal problems. Even if you are uncomfortable with this role, you become a potential resource in times of trouble. Presented by University Counseling Center. Register here .

2019-10-14	Undergraduate and Graduate Students	1CECEF31B4AD86D62540EF23F30FEDED	Education and Research Opportunities	**** Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship Workshops: Workshop information and registration: cds.library.nd.edu/workshops . Hesburgh Library workshop calendar . Questions? Email: cds@nd.edu . ∙ Using “Topic Modeling” to Extract Themes from Texts Topic modeling is a process of dividing and conquering a collection of texts in order to better understand the collection as a whole. Given a corpora of documents (books, articles, web pages, etc.) from any discipline, topic modeling divides the corpora into sub-corpora, and each sub-corpora will be identified with a theme. This process is sometimes useful for identifying genres, authors and/or subjects in a body of literature. Participants are expected to bring their own computer, and the computer is expected to have Java already installed, which it probably does. Wednesday, Oct. 17; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ DMPTool: Data Management Plans for Grant Proposals The hands-on workshop is suitable for faculty, staff and students. If your funder(s) require data management plans with grant proposal submissions, or if you write proposals or help someone who does, this workshop and the DMPTool will help you craft a compliant data management plan and share it with your colleagues or adviser and the ND research pre-award team. You’ll explore funder templates and Notre Dame-specific advice. Wednesday, Oct. 17; 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. in Room 246, Hesburgh Library ∙ Extracting the Who, What, When, Where and How from Your Journal Articles and Books Knowing the parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) associated with a given text enable you to answer question such as “What is discussed in this document, what do they do, and how do they do it?” Knowing the named entities (people, places, organization, dates, times, dollar amounts, etc.) associated with a given text enables you to answer those same questions more thoroughly. This hands-on workshop will demonstrate and facilitate the use of a locally developed tool to extract parts of speech and named entities from any plain text file. Participants will then learn how to use a free program called OpenRefine to sort and search through the results. Take this workshop, and your “reading” abilities will begin to take on new dimensions. Bring your own computer. Thursday, Oct. 18; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ Introduction to Python’s Natural Language Toolkit Python is a programming language for text mining and natural language processing. The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a very popular suite of Python modules making the process of text mining easier. Bring your own computer. Friday, Oct. 19; noon to 1:30 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library

Hesburgh Library workshop calendar . Questions? Email: cds@nd.edu . ∙ How to Make a Book This hands-on workshop will demonstrate and provide opportunities to bind books using any one of three different techniques: using a machine to do coil binding, using a machine to do adhesive binding or making a book with a “slot & tab” method and absolutely no tools — only paper. Monday, Sept. 10; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ Introduction to Text and Data Mining This hands-on session affords participants to learn the benefits of using computers to analyze textual corpora such as a collection of books or journal articles. Sometimes called “distant” or “scalable” reading, text mining — a form of digital humanities research — is a way to literally count and tabulate the frequency of words (or phrases) in a text in order to find patterns and anomalies within it. Wednesday, Sept. 12; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ Introduction to R R is the leading open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics.

No prior knowledge is assumed. Wednesday, Sept. 12; 1 to 2 p.m. in Room 246, Hesburgh Library ∙ Preparing Files for Text and Data Mining Text mining, a process for extracting information from unstructured text, requires everyday files (PDF, Word, HTML, etc.) to be transformed into plain text files.

Thursday, Sept. 13; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ Using a Concordance to “Read” Many Texts Simultaneously Modern-day concordances help the reader identify statistically significant key words and word collocations, as well as navigate a text in question. This workshop will demonstrate and facilitate the use of a free, cross-platform concordance program called AntConc to do all of these things and more. Think of it as if it were a search engine for your own personal corpora. Got lots of digital books or articles you need to read? Bring them and your computer to this workshop and learn how navigate them as a whole. Friday, Sept. 14; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ Geographic Information Systems (GIS): A Brief Introduction GIS is a system of hardware and software for the storage, retrieval, mapping and analysis of geographic data.

2019-8-26	Undergraduate and Graduate Students	4D3763C14C5B7BEC2540EF23F30FEDED	Education and Research Opportunities	∙ “Digital Foundations for Humanities Research” This workshop has participants practice using foundational digital tools with humanities data sets, and offers real-world examples of their use in scholarship. Suitable for newcomers hoping to discover what digital humanities are all about and for those more comfortable in the digital world but who want to see what undiscovered resources are available. -Tuesday, Aug. 28; 11 a.m. to noon in Room 246, Hesburgh Library -Wednesday, Aug. 29; 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. ∙ “Introduction to Text and Data Mining” This hands-on session affords participants to learn the benefits of using computers to analyze textual corpora such as a collection of books or journal articles. Sometimes called “distant” or “scalable” reading, text mining — a form of digital humanities research — is a way to literally count and tabulate the frequency of words (or phrases) in a text in order to find patterns and anomalies within it. Wednesday, Aug. 29; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ “Preparing Files for Text and Data Mining” This hands-on workshop will demonstrate and facilitate the use of a free Java-based program called Tika. More specifically, this workshop will help attendees install Tika and use it to convert just about any file into plain text, and then participants will be empowered to use a myriad of text mining services available on the internet. Thursday, Aug. 30; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library ∙ “Using a Concordance to ‘Read’ Many Texts Simultaneously” Concordances are centuries-old tools used to “read” and understand large volumes of text. Modern-day concordances also help the reader identify statistically significant key words and word collocations, as well as navigate a text in question. This workshop will demonstrate and facilitate the use of a free, cross-platform concordance program called AntConc to do all of these things and more. Think of it as if it were a search engine for your own personal corpora. Got lots of digital books or articles you need to read? Bring them and your computer to this workshop and learn how navigate them as a whole. Friday, Aug. 31; noon to 1 p.m. in Room 247, Hesburgh Library

2019-5-13	Undergraduates and Graduate Students	940175A066FA9A2F2540EF23F30FEDED	Arts and Performances	Michiana Jewish Film Festival The Jewish Federation of St. Joseph Valley invites all to join in as we explore Jewish culture and heritage through the artistic lens of cinema. Monday through Thursday evenings, May 14 through 17, in the Browning Cinema, DeBartolo Performing Arts Center Ticket prices are the same for all films. Students: $4. Faculty/Staff: $6. • “Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story” (2017) Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr fled an oppressive marriage to create a name for herself as one of Hollywood’s top leading ladies in the 1940s. Behind the glamour and sex appeal, though, was a talented and inquisitive inventor. Preceded by a screening of the short film “Stitchers: Tapestry of Spirit” (2017) , about female artisans of different faiths and parts of the world who joined together in an ambitious and unifying project to recreate the entire Torah scroll in needlepoint. View trailer . Monday, May 14; 5:15 p.m. • “Foxtrot” (2017) A troubled family must face facts when something goes terribly wrong at their son’s desolate military post. Eschewing a realistic approach to that storyline, the three-part narrative takes a metaphorical route to open cultural and political questions central to Israeli current affairs not often addressed so boldly in the cinema. View trailer . Monday, May 14; 8 p.m. • “GI Jews: Jewish Americans in World War II” (2017) This documentary tells the story of the 550,000 Jewish American men and women who fought in World War II. In their own words, veterans both famous and unknown, including director Mel Brooks and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, bring their war experiences to life: how they fought for their nation and their people, struggled with anti-Semitism within their ranks and emerged transformed, more powerfully American and more deeply Jewish. Preceded by a screening of the short film “116 Cameras” (2017) , about Holocaust survivor Eva Schloss who preserves her story interactively so that she will be able to tell it forever. View trailer . Tuesday, May 15; 5:15 p.m. • “1945” (2017) On a summer day in 1945, an Orthodox man and his grown son return to a village in Hungary while the villagers prepare for the wedding of the town clerk’s son. The townspeople, suspicious, remorseful, fearful and cunning, expect the worst and behave accordingly. The town clerk fears the men may be heirs of the village’s deported Jews and expects them to demand their illegally acquired property back. View trailer . Tuesday, May 15; 8 p.m. • “Remember Baghdad” (2016) Five families from the Jewish community look back on a scarcely imaginable time in Baghdad: Iraq was booming, it was pleasure-seeking and there was inter-communal trust. Today, after decades of war and instability, Iraq is a very different place. With intimate interviews, personal viewpoints, extensive personal and news archives, and footage from Iraq today, the documentary shows how the disintegration began in a country that has exploded into our lives today. Preceded by a screening of the short film “El Hara” (2017) , which follows one man’s break with the neighborhood of his youth, the Jewish quarter of Tunis, highlighting how such moments of rupture haunt us. View trailer . Wednesday, May 16; 5:15 p.m. • “The Last Suit” (2018) Abraham Bursztein (Miguel Ángel Solá), an octogenarian Jewish tailor set to enter the nursing home, runs away from Buenos Aires to Poland, where he proposes to find a friend who saved him from certain death at the end of World War II. After seven decades without any contact with him, Abraham will try to find his old friend and keep his promise to return one day. View trailer . Wednesday, May 16; 8 p.m. • “Keep the Change” (2018) When aspiring filmmaker David (Brandon Polansky) is mandated by a judge to attend a social program at the Jewish Community Center, he is sure of one thing: He doesn’t belong there. But when he’s assigned to visit the Brooklyn Bridge with the vivacious Sarah (Samantha Elisofon), sparks fly and his convictions are tested. Their budding relationship must weather Sarah’s romantic past, David’s judgmental mother (Jessica Walter from “Arrested Development”), and their own preconceptions of what love is supposed to look like. Preceded by a screening of the short film “The Chop” (2015) , about a charismatic Kosher butcher who loses his job and decides to pretend to be Muslim in order to get work at a Halal butcher. View trailer . Thursday, May 17; 5:15 p.m. • “The Wedding Plan” (2016) Often compared to “My Big Fat Greek Wedding,” this Israeli comedy infuses the spirit of that classic with both faith and fate. In her 30s, Orthodox Michal (Noa Kooler) is set to be married at the end of the month, but her marriage plans implode (or explode — or both, really) when her fiancé ends their relationship decisively. Undeterred, Michal keeps her dress and refuses to cancel the wedding, insisting that she will be supplied a husband. With less than a month before her wedding, the short clock has Michal on a mission to find the right man for the job. View trailer . Thursday, May 17; 8 p.m.

Kennedy in 1960 and the close of the Second Vatican Council in 1965, Catholics finally became fully American. Or so we’ve been told. This triumph occluded the experience of non-white Catholics.

Cressler (College of Charleston) will argue that centering the stories of Black Catholics requires us to reimagine our histories of American Catholicism.

We are pleased to welcome back renowned improv artists Carys Kresny (ND Dept. of Film, Television and Theatre, SB Civic Theater, The Lark Comedy Institute) and Kelli McBride (The Lark Comedy Institute, Second City Chicago, Improv Olympic, Annoyance Theater) to facilitate this innovative workshop.

Later that day, he and a few friends took up a collection for the South Bend Center for the Homeless.
